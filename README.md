# Matcha

This is a Flexible, Responsive and Powerful UI framework, what I want it to be. ;-)

Matcha is a library based on [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), so you should install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and Compass before use.

## Dependencies

- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) = 3.0.0
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) >= 3.2.14
- Compass >= 0.12.3
