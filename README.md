# Matcha

This is a Flexible, Responsive and Powerful UI framework, what I want it to be. ;-)

Matcha is a library based on ~~[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)~~[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), so you should install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and ~~Compass~~Sass before use.

## Dependencies

- [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) = 3.0.0
- Sass >= 3.3.0
